\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Overview}
The BlackArch Linux guide is divided into several parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction - Provides a broad overview, introduction, and additional helpful project information
\item User Guide - Everything a typical user needs to know to effectively use BlackArch
\item Developer Guide - How to get started developing for and contributing to BlackArch
\item Tool Guide - In-depth tool details along example usages (WIP)
\end{itemize}

\section{What is BlackArch Linux?}
BlackArch is a complete Linux distribution for penetration testers and security researchers.
It is derived from \href{https://www.archlinux.org/}{ArchLinux} and users can install BlackArch components
individually or in groups directly on top of it.

The toolset is distributed as an Arch Linux
\href{https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unofficial\_User\_Repositories}
{unofficial user repository} so you can install BlackArch on top of an
existing Arch Linux installation. Packages may be installed individually or by
category.

The constantly expanding repository currently includes over \href{https://www.blackarch.org/tools.html}{1300} tools.
All tools are thoroughly tested before being added to the codebase to maintain the quality of the repository.
% should quickly describe the testing methods/code review procedures etc

\chapter{User Guide}

\section{Installation}
The following sections will show you how to setup the BlackArch repository and
install packages. BlackArch supports both, installing from the repository using
binary packages as well as compiling and installing from sources.

BlackArch is compatible with normal Arch installations. It acts as an unofficial
user repository. If you want an ISO instead, see the
\href{https://www.blackarch.org/downloads.html#iso}{Live ISO} section.

\subsection{Installing on top of ArchLinux}
Run \href{https://blackarch.org/strap.sh}{strap.sh} as root and follow the
instructions. See the following example.
\begin{lstlisting}
   curl -O https://blackarch.org/strap.sh
   sha1sum strap.sh # should match: 6f152b79419491db92c1fdde3fad2d445f09aae3
   sudo ./strap.sh
\end{lstlisting}

Now download a fresh copy of the master package list and synchronize packages:
\begin{lstlisting}
  sudo pacman -Syyu
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Installing packages}
You may now install tools from the blackarch repository.
\begin{enumerate}
\item To list all of the available tools, run
\begin{lstlisting}
  pacman -Sgg | grep blackarch | cut -d' ' -f2 | sort -u
\end{lstlisting}

\item To install all of the tools, run
\begin{lstlisting}
  pacman -S blackarch
\end{lstlisting}

\item To install a category of tools, run
\begin{lstlisting}
  pacman -S blackarch-<category>
\end{lstlisting}

\item To see the blackarch categories, run
\begin{lstlisting}
  pacman -Sg | grep blackarch
\end{lstlisting}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Installing packages from source}
As part of an alternative method of installation, you can build the BlackArch
packages from source. You can find the PKGBUILDs on
\href{https://github.com/BlackArch/blackarch/tree/master/packages}{github}. To
build the entire repo, you can use the
\href{https://github.com/BlackArch/blackman}{Blackman} tool.
\begin{itemize}
\item First, you have to install Blackman. If the BlackArch package repository
is setup on your machine, you can install Blackman:
\begin{lstlisting}
  pacman -S blackman
\end{lstlisting}

\item You can build and install Blackman from source:
\begin{lstlisting}
  mkdir blackman
  cd blackman
  wget https://raw2.github.com/BlackArch/blackarch/master/packages/blackman/PKGBUILD
  # Make sure the PKGBUILD has not been maliciously tampered with.
  makepkg -s
\end{lstlisting}

\item Or you can install Blackman from the AUR:
\begin{lstlisting}
  <whatever AUR helper you use> -S blackman
\end{lstlisting}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Basic Blackman usage} Blackman is very simple to use, though the flags are different from what you
would typically expect from something like pacman. Basic usage has been outlined below.
\begin{itemize}
\item Download, compile and install packages:
\begin{lstlisting}
  sudo blackman -i package
\end{lstlisting}

\item Download, compile and install whole category:
\begin{lstlisting}
  sudo blackman -g group
\end{lstlisting}

\item Download, compile and install all of the BlackArch tools:
\begin{lstlisting}
  sudo blackman -a
\end{lstlisting}

\item To list the blackarch categories:
\begin{lstlisting}
  blackman -l
\end{lstlisting}

\item To list category tools:
\begin{lstlisting}
  blackman -p category
\end{lstlisting}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Installing from live-, netinstall- ISO or ArchLinux}
You can install BlackArch Linux from one of our live- or netinstall-ISOs.\\See
\url{https://www.blackarch.org/download.html#iso}. The following steps are
required after the ISO boot up.
\begin{itemize}
\item Install blackarch-installer package:
\begin{lstlisting}
  sudo pacman -S blackarch-installer
\end{lstlisting}

\item Run
\begin{lstlisting}
  sudo blackarch-install
\end{lstlisting}

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Developer Guide}

\section{Arch's Build System and Repositories}

PKGBUILD files are build scripts. Each one tells makepkg(1) how to create a
package. PKGBUILD files are written in Bash.

For more information, read (or skim through) the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Creating_Packages}{Arch Wiki: Creating Packages}
\item \href{https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg}{Arch Wiki: makepkg}
\item \href{https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD}{Arch Wiki: PKGBUILD}
\item \href{https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Packaging_Standards}{Arch Wiki: Arch Packaging Standards}
\end{itemize}

\section{Blackarch PKGBUILD standards}
For the sake of simplicity, our PKGBUILDs are similar to that of the AUR ones,
with a few small differences outlined below. Every package must
belong to blackarch at the minimum, there will also be a lot of crossover with
multiple packages belonging to multiple groups.

\subsection{Groups}
To allow users to install a specific range of packages quickly and easily,
packages have been separated into groups. Groups allow users to simply
go "pacman -S <group name>" in order to pull a lot of packages.

\subsubsection{blackarch}
The blackarch group is the base group that all packages must belong too. This allows
users to install every package with ease.

What should be in here: Everything.

\subsubsection{blackarch-anti-forensic}

\item Commit your changes.
\item Push your changes.
\item Ask us to merge in your changes, preferably through a pull request.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Example}
The following example demonstrates submitting a new package to the BlackArch
project. We use \href{https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/yaourt}{yaourt}
(you can use pacaur as well) to fetch a pre-existing PKGBUILD file for
\textbf{nfsshell} from the \href{https://aur.archlinux.org/}{AUR} and adjust it
according to our needs.

\subsubsection{Fetch PKGBUILD}
Fetch the \textit{PKGBUILD} file using yaourt or pacaur:
\begin{lstlisting}
  user@blackarchlinux $ yaourt -G nfsshell
  ==> Download nfsshell sources
  x LICENSE
  x PKGBUILD
  x gcc.patch
  user@blackarchlinux $ cd nfsshell/
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Clean up PKGBUILD}
Clean up the \textit{PKGBUILD} file and save some time:
\begin{lstlisting}
  user@blackarchlinux nfsshell $ ./blackarch/scripts/prep PKGBUILD
  cleaning 'PKGBUILD'...
  expanding tabs...
  removing vim modeline...
  removing id comment...
  removing contributor and maintainer comments...
  squeezing extra blank lines...
  removing '|| return'...
  removing leading blank line...
  removing $pkgname...
  removing trailing whitespace...
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Adjust PKGBUILD}
Adjust the \textit{PKGBUILD} file:
\begin{lstlisting}
  user@blackarchlinux nfsshell $ vi PKGBUILD
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Build the package}
Build the package:
\begin{lstlisting}user@blackarchlinux nfsshell $ makepkg -sf
==> Making package: nfsshell 19980519-1 (Mon Dec  2 17:23:51 CET 2013)
==> Checking runtime dependencies...
==> Checking buildtime dependencies...

==> Finished making: nfsshell 19980519-1 (Mon Dec  2 17:23:53 CET 2013)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Install and test the package}
Install and test the package:
\begin{lstlisting}
  user@blackarchlinux nfsshell $ pacman -U nfsshell-19980519-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
  user@blackarchlinux nfsshell $ nfsshell # test it
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Add, commit and push package}
Add, commit and push the package
\begin{lstlisting}user@blackarchlinux nfsshell $ cd /blackarchlinux/packages
user@blackarchlinux ~/blackarchlinux/packages $ mv ~/nfsshell .
user@blackarchlinux ~/blackarchlinux/packages $ git commit -am nfsshell && git push
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Create a pull request}
Create a pull request on \href{https://github.com/}{github.com}
\begin{lstlisting}
  firefox https://github.com/<contributor>/blackarchlinux
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Adding a remote for upstream}
A smart thing to do if you're working upstream and on a fork is to pull your own fork and add the main ba repo as a remote
\begin{lstlisting}
  user@blackarchlinux ~/blackarchlinux $ git remote -v
  origin <the url of your fork> (fetch)
  origin <the url of your fork> (push)
  user@blackarchlinux ~/blackarchlinux $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/blackarch/blackarch
  user@blackarchlinux ~/blackarchlinux $ git remote -v
  origin <the url of your fork> (fetch)
  origin <the url of your fork> (push)
  upstream https://github.com/blackarch/blackarch (fetch)
  upstream https://github.com/blackarch/blackarch (push)
\end{lstlisting}

By default, git should push straight to origin, but make sure your git config is
configured correctly. This won't be an issue unless you have commit rights as
you won't be able to push upstream without them.

If you do have the ability to commit, you might have more success using
\textit{git@github.com:blackarch/blackarch.git} but it's up to you.

\subsection{Requests}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Don't add \textbf{Maintainer} or \textbf{Contributor} comments to
\textit{PKGBUILD} files. Add maintainer and contributor names to the
AUTHORS section of BlackArch guide.
\item For the sake of consistency, please follow the general style of the other
\textit{PKGBUILD} files in the repo and use two-space indentation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{General tips}
\href{http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Namcap}{namcap} can check packages for
errors.
